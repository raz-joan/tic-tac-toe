## Overview  
  This solo project is meant to demonstrate my understanding of the Mod1 curriculum. The overall goal of the project was to design, plan, and build a functional tic-tac-toe game from scratch. The game should follow the general tic-tac-toe rules of rotating turns until one of the two players wins by having three tokens in a row, column, or diagonal. A few additional features included: displaying the current player's name before they play their token, displaying the winners name upon a win, displaying each player's scores, and being able to retrieve these scores from local storage so that they persist through a page refresh.  

## Project Goals  
  The learning goals of this project were to:
    - solidify and demonstrate your understanding of DRY JS, localStorage to persist data, and event delegation to handle similar event listeners.
    - understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM.
    - iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops.
    - use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside "answer" to a logical challenge.
