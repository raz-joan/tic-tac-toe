## Overview  
  This solo project is meant to demonstrate my understanding of the Mod1 curriculum. The overall goal of the project was to design, plan, and build a functional tic-tac-toe game from scratch. The game should follow the general tic-tac-toe rules of rotating turns until one of the two players wins by having three tokens in a row, column, or diagonal. A few additional features included: displaying the current player's name before they play their token, displaying the winners name upon a win, displaying each player's scores, and being able to retrieve these scores from local storage so that they persist through a page refresh.  

## Project Goals  
  The learning goals of this project were to:  
  - solidify and demonstrate your understanding of DRY JS, localStorage to persist data, and event delegation to handle similar event listeners.  
  - understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM.  
  - iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops.  
  - use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside "answer" to a logical challenge.    

### Project Spec  
  You can find the project rubric [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/tic-tac-toe-solo.html).  

## Technologies  
  Technologies used were: CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.  

## Code Architecture  
  The application consists of one HTML file (index.html), one CSS file (styles.css), and three JavaScript files (game.js, player.js, and main.js). The HTML provides the structure of the application, the CSS provides the styling of this structure, and the JavaScript provides the behavior needed to update the structure, the data models and the DOM. There are two class files, Game and Player, which store the information for each player and the current game, and then the main.js file contains the queried variables, event listeners and handlers, as well as, the functions that update the data models and then the DOM.
